The goal is to create a webpage that displays the books read or unread by the user.

  A button will allow the user to input data about the book into a form.
  
  Once pressed, a form will be displayed for user to input info.
  
  Once inputted and saved by user, the info will be used to create a new Book object
  
  The new Book will be pushed onto the array 
  
  With the array updated, the display will also be updated to include the new book
